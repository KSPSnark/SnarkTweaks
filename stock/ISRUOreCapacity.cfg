// I don't know if you're as dumb as *I* am... but time and time again I'll carefully
// put together a mission with a mining/refining ship on it, and then FORGET TO PUT
// THE DARN ORE TANKS ON, with the result that it can't actually do anything because
// the drills don't have anywhere to put their ore so that the ISRU can process it.
//
// This little patch adds a small amount of ore capacity to the ISRU itself, so that
// the above scenario can never happen.
