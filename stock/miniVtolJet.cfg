// Creates a new part, the JV-6 "Vito" VTOL Assist Jet. This is a small, high
// thrust, air-breathing linear RCS thruster, with half the thrust of a Vernor
// and about a third that of a Juno.  Like jet engines, it requires intake
// air and runs on liquid fuel only (no oxidizer). Its Isp is significantly
// worse than the jet engines, but (being air-breathing) is a lot better than
// LFO engines. It's useful as a VTOL assist for small airplanes.
//
// No model files needed, works fine in stock-- it just re-uses a rescaled
// version of the Juno's model.  :-)
